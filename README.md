This piece of code from the entire global programming tree is my portfolio. This project was named SystemGirl because in the future, this piece of code will live in your computers, take care of them, and help you work on them.
For now, SystemGirl hasn't reached adulthood and is still figuring out what she wants to do (the project is in development, and this repository is a caricature).
